EEG_func performs frequency analysis on the CSV exported from Mind Monitor (unzipped). Note that the sampling rate is calculated automatically by the subroutine. It is strongly advised to set it at the maximum rate available (256 Hz) from the app itself. Also, this subroutine assumes that the CSV are unzipped, and it compresses them into GZ format. Note that before the subroutine itself, I report another function that I wrote to handle the timestamp, that is called inside the EEG function.
