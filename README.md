EEG_func performs frequency analysis on the CSV exported from Mind Monitor (unzipped). Note that the sampling rate is calculated automatically by the subroutine. It is strongly advised to set it at the maximum rate available (256 Hz) from the app itself. Also, this subroutine assumes that the CSVs are unzipped, and it compresses them into GZ format. Another function (epoch) is called inside EEG_func to transform the date of each reading into a timestamp. An example of the use of this analysis can be found here: https://paolomaccallini.wordpress.com/2025/09/19/use-of-quantitative-eeg-as-objective-measure-of-subjective-symptoms/
